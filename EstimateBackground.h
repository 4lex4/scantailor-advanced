/**
 * \brief Estimates a grayscale background of a scanned page.
 *
 * \param input The image of a page.
 * \param area_to_consider The area in \p input image coordinates to consider.
 *        The resulting surface will only be valid in that area.
 *        This parameter can be an empty polygon, in which case all of the
 *        \p input image area is considered.
 * \param status The status of a task.  If it's cancelled by another thread,
 *        this function may throw an implementation-defined exception.
 * \param dbg The sink for intermediate images used for debugging purposes.
 *        This argument is optional.
 *
 * This implementation can deal with very complex cases, like a page with
 * a picture covering most of it, but in return, it expects some conditions
 * to be met:
 * -# The orientation must be correct.  To be precise, it can deal with
 *    a more or less vertical folding line, but not a horizontal one.
 * -# The page must have some blank margins.  The margins must be of
 *    a natural origin, or to be precise, there must not be a noticeable
 *    transition between the page background and the margins.
 * -# It's better to provide a single page to this function, not a
 *    two page scan.  When cutting off one of the pages, feel free
 *    to fill areas near the the edges with black.
 * -# This implementation can handle dark surroundings around the page,
 *    provided they touch the edges, but it performs better without them.
