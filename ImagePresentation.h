/**
 * Image presentation consists of 3 components:
 * \li A transformation from pixel coordinates to some arbitrary virtual coordinates.
 *     Such transformation usually comes from an instance of ImageTransformation.
 * \li Image crop area, in virtual coordinates, that specifies which parts of the
 *     image should be visible.
 * \li Display area, in virtual coordinates, which is usually the bounding box
 *     of the image crop area, but can be larger, to reserve space for custom drawing
 *     or extra controls.
