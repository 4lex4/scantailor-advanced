     * \brief Workarounds some problems with QPainter::drawPixmap().
     *
     * This method is more or less equivalent to:
     * \code
     * QPainter::drawPixmap(0, 0, pixmap);
     * \endcode
     * However, there are two problems with the above code:\n
     * 1. On X11, QPainter doesn't (as of Qt 4.4.0) use XRender if
     *    a transformation is applied.  We call XRender manually, but
     *    note that not all features of QPainter are implemented.
     *    In particular, clipping will be done by the bounding box
     *    of the requested clip region.\n
     * 2. On Windows, the above code is very slow if a large zoom is
     *    specified in QPainter.  To fix that we calculate the region of
     *    the image to be displayed and pass it to the rendering engine.
