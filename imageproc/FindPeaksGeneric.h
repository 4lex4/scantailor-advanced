/**
 * \brief Finds positive or negative peaks on a 2D grid.
 *
 * A peak is defined as a cell or an 8-connected group of cells that is more
 * significant than any of its neighbor cells.  More significant means either
 * greater or less, depending on the kind of peaks we want to locate.
 * In addition, we provide functionality to suppress peaks that are
 * in a specified neighborhood of a more significant peak.
 *
 * \param most_significant A functor or a pointer to a free function that
 *        can be called with two arguments of type T and return the bigger
 *        or the smaller of the two.
 * \param least_significant Same as most_significant, but the oposite operation.
 * \param increase_significance A functor or a pointer to a free function that
 *        takes one argument and returns the next most significant value next
 *        to it.  Hint: for floating point data, use the std::nextafter() family of
 *        functions.  Their generic versions are available in Boost.
 * \param peak_mutator A functor or a pointer to a free function that will
 *        transform a peak value.  Two typical cases would be returning
 *        the value as is and returning a fixed value.
 * \param non_peak_mutator Same as peak_mutator, but for non-peak values.
 * \param neighborhood The area around a peak (centered at width/2, height/2)
 *        in which less significant peaks will be suppressed.  Passing an empty
 *        neighborhood is equivalent of passing a 1x1 neighborhood.
 * \param outside_values Values that are assumed to be outside of the grid bounds.
 *        This will affect peak detection at the edges of grid.
 * \param[in,out] data Pointer to the data buffer.
 * \param stride The size of a row in the data buffer, in terms of the number of T objects.
 * \param size Grid dimensions.
