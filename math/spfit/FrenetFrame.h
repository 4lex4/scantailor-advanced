   * does matter, as we want the unit normal vector divided by signed curvature give
   * us the center of the curvature.  For that to be the case, normal vector's direction
   * relative to the unit vector's direction must be the same as the Y axis direction
   * relative to the X axis direction in the coordinate system from which we derive
   * the curvature.  For 2D computer graphics, the right direction is Y_POINTS_DOWN.
