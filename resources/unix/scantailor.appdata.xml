    <p>
      ScanTailor Advanced is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages.
      It performs operations such as page splitting, deskewing, adding/removing borders, and others.
      You give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be printed or assembled into a PDF or DJVU file.
      Scanning, optical character recognition, and assembling multi-page documents are out of scope of this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      ScanTailor Advanced is Free Software (which is more than just freeware).
      Itâ€™s written in C++ with Qt and released under the General Public License version 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      ScanTailor Advanced is being used not just by enthusiasts, but also by libraries and other institutions.
