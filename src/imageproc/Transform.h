 * \param background_color Used to fill areas not represented in the source image.
 * \param weak_background If set to true, \p background_color is only taken
 *        into account if a target pixel maps to an area completely outside of
 *        the source image.  That is, if at least one source image pixel

 *        treated equally.
 * \param min_mapping_area Defines the minimum rectangle in the source image
 *        that maps to a destination pixel.  This can be used to control
 *        smoothing.
 * \return The transformed image.  It's format may differ from the
 *         source image format, for example Format_Indexed8 may
 *         be transformed to Format_RGB32, if the source image
 *         contains colors other than shades of gray.
